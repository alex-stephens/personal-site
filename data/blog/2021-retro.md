Well, well, well, 2022 has rolled around, and you know what that means – it's been about a year since I posted anything on this darn website (unless you count [this](http://alexstephens.net/blog/2021-roundup)).

Anyway, it's time for some reflectin'...

# Timeline

So, what actually happened in my life in 2021? Quite a lot actually!

Here's the big picture stuff:

* Became MCR President at my Oxford College (Exeter) in January – took my responsibility level within college from 0 to 100 real quick!
* Until around April, the UK was in pretty heavy Covid-19 lockdown. This didn't ease up substantially till May, and only in June/July were things mostly back to normal.
* Moved out of college accommodation in July, into a lovely share house with a group of friends.
* Did my first triathlon in August! Signed up on a whim only a month or so prior, not realising at the time how big of a decision this would be...
* In December, flew back to Sydney for the first time since leaving in September 2020.

## Putting myself out there

This general idea of "putting myself out there"

## What I'm grateful for

Honestly, I have a lot to be grateful for about how this year went for me. For a lot of people I know, it was basically a year of pandemic, a year of not being able to do what they wanted to do, a year of waiting it out until things improve. In some ways it was all that for me as well, but the novelty of it being my first full year living in Oxford meant it was an exciting year anyway.

A few particular things to be grateful for:

* Remaining in good health – a big one, once again.
* Settling in to the UK – now that I've been there for more than a year, it properly feels like home to me, and I'm glad to have a well established group of friends in Oxford at this point.
* Discovering triathlon – this wasn't even on my radar at the start of the year, but for some reason when an event came up as I was scrolling on my phone, I decided it'd be fun to sign up for. I'm super glad I did, since it's broadened my sports interests a lot and been a ton of fun so far.
