Well, well, well, 2022 has rolled around, and you know what that means – it's been about a year since I posted anything on this darn website (unless you count [this](http://localhost:3000/blog/2021-roundup)).

Anyway, it's time for some reflectin'...

# Timeline

So, what actually happened in my life in 2021? Quite a lot actually!

Here's the big picture stuff:

* Became MCR President at my Oxford College (Exeter) in January – took my responsibility level within college from 0 to 100 real quick!
* Until around April, the UK was in pretty heavy Covid-19 lockdown. This didn't ease up substantially till May, and only in June/July were things mostly back to normal.
* Moved out of college accommodation in July, into a lovely share house with a group of friends.
* Did my first triathlon in August! Signed up on a whim only a month or so prior, not realising at the time how big of a decision this would be...
* In December, flew back to Sydney for the first time since leaving in September 2020.
