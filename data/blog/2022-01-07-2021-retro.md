## Timeline

The big picture events in 2021 for me:

* January: became MCR President at my Oxford College (Exeter) â€“ my responsibility level went from 0 to 100 real quick!
* July: moved out of college accommodation into a lovely share house with a group of friends.
* August: did my first triathlon! Signed up on a whim only a month or so prior, not realising at the time how big of a decision this would be...
* December: first trip back to Sydney since leaving in September 2020.
