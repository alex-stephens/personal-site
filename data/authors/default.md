## Christmas break!

I've been back home in Sydney for most of December, enjoying a break after a busy year and hanging out with friends I haven't seen in a while. Also taken the opportunity to soak in some vitamin D before I head back into UK winter later this week...


## Plans for 2022

### Academia

This will be my first full (calendar) year working on the research side of my PhD, which is exciting as well as a little stressful to think about.

### Running/triathlon

I've got two big events that I'm really looking forward to â€“ Brighton Marathon in April, and Ironman 70.3 Finland (!) in July. Both of these will be insanely challenging milestones for me, and if I can make it to the end of them without injuring myself I'll be absolutely thrilled. Lots of training to think about before then though.

### College life

On the Exeter College side, I'll be wrapping up my stint as MCR President in a couple of weeks. It's been a fun ride, but glad to be done with it to free up the time for other things... It's going to be a big year!
