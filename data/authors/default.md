This is my [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). Last updated **2022-03-08**.

## Post-Covid

I had the (pretty inevitable) misfortune of contracting Covid in mid-February – my symptoms were relatively mild during isolation, but the fatigue has stuck around and is still very noticeable some days. Hopefully this starts to fade away soon...

## Academia

Continuing work on my safe exploration project – missed the originally intended submission deadline (IROS 2022), now looking at turning it into a journal paper, possibly for submission to T-RO.

## Running/triathlon

Ran the Cambridge Half this past weekend, coming away with a new PB of 1:45:56. This was after a month of hardly running at all due to a mild knee injury as well as Covid – I felt completely fine for almost the entire race, and the knee did start to ache a little towards the end but not enough to slow me down much.

This has left me unsure about whether I'll be able to manage the Brighton Marathon, which is now in *less than a month*. I'm still hopeful, but it will take some careful balancing to maintain some level of fitness without worsening my underlying injuries.

## Social life

Coming to the end of a busy Hilary term – while it's been nice having loads of social events to go to each week, the quieter time between terms will be a welcome respite (and chance to get a bit more work done, hopefully). I've also recently (for the first time ever) had a go on the good ol' dating apps, which has been a fun experience so far – maybe I'll do a blog post about that at some point...
