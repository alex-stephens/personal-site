Hey, I'm Alex! I'm from Sydney, currently living in the UK where I'm working towards a PhD in Robotics at the University of Oxford.

My main research interests are in robotic autonomy and artificial intelligence, but more generally I'm interested in pretty much all things tech and space.

If you want to learn a bit more about me, check out my [now page](/now/) or [CV](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf). Feel free to get in touch via any of the links below, I'm always keen for a chat!
