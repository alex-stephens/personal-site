This is my [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

### Academia

Working on contributing to a paper on non-cooperative multi-agent pathfinding for [AAMAS 2022](https://aamas2022-conference.auckland.ac.nz/).

Shortly will become a full-time DPhil researcher, having completed my first year with the [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/). Feeling generally optimistic about my research path for the next couple of years.

### College life

About to start a new academic year as MCR President at [Exeter College, Oxford](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/) -- busy preparing for Freshers' Week, but excited for a new term which should be my first experience of Oxford social life at its best, after a year of Covid restrictions.

### Staying active

Been having a particularly great time of my running routine the past few months, fitness is decent and it's good to have races and [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) happening again to keep things interesting.

Running my first half marathon soon -- Oxford Half on October 18th!

Looking forward to signing up for the Oxford Uni Triathlon Club for the new academic year, to hopefully bring a new social side to my training.

### Vibes

Starting to think about some travel plans for the coming months -- excited to take advantage of the world opening up again.
