This is my [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now).

### Academia

Foundational reading towards my core DPhil work, which is looking like it'll be something in multi-agent coordination under uncertainty. Alongside this, also working on a project in safe exploration, which will hopefully lead to a chance to work with a [Spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7atZfX85nd4) robot in the near future.


### College life

Coming to the end of my final term as MCR President at [Exeter College, Oxford](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/). This term has been by far the most enjoyable of my three - less Covid restrictions, more social activities, and generally a good time.

### Staying active

Did some nice events recently â€“ came away from Oxford Half in October with a 1:50:48, which I was thrilled with. Also took part in the BUCS Duathlon in November along with a bunch of people from [OUTriC](https://www.outric.co.uk/), which was great fun.

Overall, haven't been quite as active in OUTriC this term as I'd hoped, due to being busy with everything else. Hopefully will be able to devote myself to it a bit more next term.

Training for Brighton Marathon in April 2022 starts soon!

### Vibes

Looking forward to travelling soon! Off to Dublin next week for a short holiday, and then back to Sydney at the end of December for 3 weeks.
