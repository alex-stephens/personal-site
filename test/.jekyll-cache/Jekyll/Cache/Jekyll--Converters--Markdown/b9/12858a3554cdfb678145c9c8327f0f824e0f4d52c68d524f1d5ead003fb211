  <p>The Lhasa Apso (/ËˆlÉ‘ËsÉ™ ËˆÃ¦psoÊŠ/ lah-sÉ™ ap-soh) is a non-sporting dog breed originating in Tibet. It was bred as an interior sentinel in the Buddhist monasteries, to alert the monks to any intruders who entered. Lhasa is the capital city of Tibet, and apso is a word in the Tibetan language meaning â€œbeardedâ€, so, Lhasa Apso simply means â€œlong-haired Lhasa dogâ€. There are, however, some who claim that the word â€œapsoâ€ is a form of the Tibetan word â€œrapsoâ€, meaning â€œgoat-likeâ€, which would make the equivalent translation â€œwooly Lhasa dogâ€.</p>
